## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joshua, originally from Minnesota but relocated to the greater Denver area a few years ago. My college background is Information Technology and Systems and I currently work as a Data Center Support Technician at a major Tier 3 colocation Data Center. I really love anything in the Tech industry and Tech is my greatest passion. My github profile here is dedicated solely to my Development/Programming side in Tech. Mainly focusing on Web Development, Database Management, SQL, Analytics and other types of programming and or DEVOP realted stuff I've been working on. My goal is to move out of the hardware side and get more into a DevOp or software engineering role so I lot of what I will being doing here is setting up different projects and portfolios aon my skillset as well as just have some fun Designing and tapping into my creative side.
